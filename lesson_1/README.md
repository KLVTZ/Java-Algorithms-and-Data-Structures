=========

The following program allows you to calculate the perimeter and area of a Circle with a Radius of 3.2.
By taking advantage of Java's Data types and Variables, we are able to create four floats. One float, PI, is a constant variable that doesn't change -since its assignment is the value of PI itself.
The other floats contain information for calculating the answer. We implemented two Formulas, Perimeter being 2(PI)(Radius) and Area being PI(Radius^2).
Lastly, we print the data out with a combination of a sting and concatenation of the variable for perimeter and area.
Ultimately, the program demonstrates the simplistic power of integers and variables within Java's library.
